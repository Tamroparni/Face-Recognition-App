## Features
- Capture photos using the device's camera.
- Detect faces in real-time using ML Kit's FaceDetection API.
- Display detailed face detection results, including smile probability and eye openness.
- Provide user feedback for no face detected or detection errors.
- Log detection results for debugging and further analysis.
